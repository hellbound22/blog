# Shellpage 0.1.0

Now having a blog the way you want is pretty easy. Just a matter to create a GitHub Pages repo, installing [Shellpage](https://crates.io/crates/shellpage), writing some Markdown files, and pushing the repo.

I wrote this beacause I wanted the freedom of actually writing a web page, with the simplicity and expandability of working on a terminal enviroment. 
This blog still as bland as pure HTML but give it time, i'm no web designer.

There are still a bunch of features that I want to include both in Shellpage and here in the blog, including but not limted to:

- Better indexing of the posts
- Comments (that will require integration with GitHub)
- Tags 
- More control over the formatting

But still, not bad for a weekend project. I acomplished what I set out to do.

Check out the [Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/shellpage) page and the [GitHub](https://github.com/hellbound22/shellpage) of the project.
