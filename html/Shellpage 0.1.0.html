  <h1>Shellpage 0.1.0</h1>
<p>Now having a blog the way you want is pretty easy. Just a matter to create a GitHub Pages repo, installing <a href="https://crates.io/crates/shellpage">Shellpage</a>, writing some Markdown files, and pushing the repo.</p>
<p>I wrote this beacause I wanted the freedom of actually writing a web page, with the simplicity and expandability of working on a terminal enviroment.
This blog still as bland as pure HTML but give it time, i'm no web designer.</p>
<p>There are still a bunch of features that I want to include both in Shellpage and here in the blog, including but not limted to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better indexing of the posts</li>
<li>Comments (that will require integration with GitHub)</li>
<li>Tags</li>
<li>More control over the formatting</li>
</ul>
<p>But still, not bad for a weekend project. I acomplished what I set out to do.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/shellpage">Crates.io</a> page and the <a href="https://github.com/hellbound22/shellpage">GitHub</a> of the project.</p>
